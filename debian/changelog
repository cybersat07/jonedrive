onedriver (0.9.1-1) focal; urgency=low

  * Filenames are now sanitized when uploading new files.
  * onedriver now only syncs metadata changes for a file from server to client if its
    contents have changed as well. This means that programs like LibreOffice will no longer
    complain about their lockfiles being updated while saving.
