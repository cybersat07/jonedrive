onedriver (0.10.0-1) focal; urgency=low
    
  * Adds AUR installation method for Arch-based distros - thanks fmoledina!
  * Add manpage for onedriver - thanks GenericGuy!
  * The onedriver systemd service now restarts itself in the event of a crash -
    thanks dipunm!
  * Fix a rare crash while syncing server-side changes missing checksums.
  * Fix a race-condition that caused uploaded files to occasionally be replaced by a 0-byte 
    copy (most commonly caused by the way LibreOffice saves files).
  * Cap number of uploads that can be in-progress at any time to 5. This makes uploading 
    uploading directories with lots of files appear to go a bit faster.
  * The account name is now displayed in the title bar if you need to reauthenticate to
    OneDrive (makes it easier to know which credentials to use when prompted).

onedriver (0.9.1-1) focal; urgency=low

  * Filenames are now sanitized when uploading new files.
  * onedriver now only syncs metadata changes for a file from server to client if its
    contents have changed as well. This means that programs like LibreOffice will no longer
    complain about their lockfiles being updated while saving.
